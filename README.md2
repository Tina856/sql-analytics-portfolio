## Step 1 – Business Domain

The project analyzes global AI-related job postings.

Each record represents a job posting published by a company in a specific year and geographic location.

The dataset includes country, region, and city information, which enables geography-based analysis of AI adoption, employment trends, and automation risk.


## Step 2 – Identify Entities & Business Tables

Based on the business domain, the dataset can be decomposed
into the following core business entities:

- **Job_Posting**  
  Central fact table. Each record represents a single AI-related
  job posting published by a company in a specific year and location.

- **Company**  
  Represents companies that publish job postings.
  One company can have multiple job postings.

- **Location**  
  Represents the geographic location of a job posting,
  including country, region, and city.
  Enables geographic and spatial analysis.

- **Time**  
  Represents the temporal dimension of the job posting,
  currently at the year level, enabling trend analysis over time.

- **Job / AI Characteristics**  
  Represents AI-related attributes such as job category,
  automation risk, or skill classification.
